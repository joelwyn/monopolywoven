Instruction
Please enter 1 for option 1 to test dice roll set 1 and 2 for option 2 to test dice roll set 2 when the terminal prompt for option

I have design the woven monopoly based on 2 main class which is players class that consist of name, position, bank, property and a map class that consist of name
price, color, type, owner, loc

I created the players statically as per the insutruction otherwise i could makes the dynamically and the coding is scalable so we could add more players or more map.
I use queue to execute the dice move instead of using array to track it.
